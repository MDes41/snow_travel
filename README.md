# Snow Travel

Snow Travel is a project built with Ruby on Rails with a postgresl database and production site hosted by heroku. The time scope of the project was two weeks worked on individually. This is a rails app that would get a JSON 16 day forecast and analyze the results to present the forecast in a way that would be easy to analyze which mountains where getting snow and what to expect from the next two weeks across those mountains.
